# eSLP

A. Description

The m-files in this repository implement the eSLP algorithm. The documentation that follows addresses the "core" issues; requirements, how-to see the results along with the videos generated by the experiments we have conducted so far as well as instruction on how to run them. Currently, we are working on modifying the m-files because they are tailor-made, e.g., dynamics, cost functions, for three specific experiments, and they along with compiler related files need to be installed in predetermined locations in the local drive.

B. Requirements

To run the m-files you will need:
1. Matlab (We used version 2019b)
2. Falcon.m found here https://www.fsd.lrg.tum.de/software/falcon-m/ (We used v1.24.2002191427)
3. TDM-GCC compiler (We used TDM-GCC Compiler Suite for Windows GCC 5 Series / GDB 7.9 Series and installed the MinGW-w64 64/32-bit Edition)
4. There are two additional files needed for the compiler to run smoothly (This process may have changed for versions after 2019b); both are included in the repository. The first is configuremingw.p information for which can be found here https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/313298-i-already-have-mingw-on-my-computer-how-do-i-configure-it-to-work-with-matlab. The second is compile.m needed to set the environment variable properly.

C. How-to

C.1. How-To : Check results and videos already generated by eSLP without any setup/Falcon/compiler needed
1. Copy any folder's content and run FinalResults.m. First, we display the results, and then a series of videos is generated, which are stored in the folder (.avi).

C.2. How-To : Setup
1. Request for a copy of Falcon.m from the link in B2. The support is great and one will be send soon. In the zip you will receive there are well-writen instructions in the file UserGuideMain.pdf (Chapter 2).
2. Open matlab and run the setup required by Falcon.m (the process is thoroughly explained in the accompanying manual). Falcon.m will automatically download many of the packages needed, e.g., IPOPT solver. We installed Falcon on folder C:\FALCON.m.v1.24.2002191427\falcon.

C.3. How-To : Run examples (requires C.2.)
1. Browse to the folder where Falcon was installed, create a subfolder, and place the files from this repository there. The files for every experiment must be placed in a different subfolder of the main Falcon folder (the one where you installed Falcon). For example, the files included in folder SetupA on this repository should be placed on folder C:\FALCON.m.v1.24.2002191427\falcon\SetupA.
2. Run file configuremingw.p and select the folder where the compiler is. We installed GCC on C:\TDM-GCC-64 and suggest this is the one used.
3. Run file compile.m. This sets the "environment" variable. We installed the necessary compiler files in C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-5.3.0-posix-seh-rt_v4-rev0\mingw64. If a different location is used change accordingly in the compile.m (first line - setenv command).
4. Run CleanSubOptimal.m so to clean up existing files.
5. Run main.m and afterwards FinalResults.m.
